This is a Flutter app that reads a QR Code and from the URL it reads, accesses the Firebase database I created to redirect the user to a customized app structure original to the URL. 

This was made in mind with cafes and restaurants, where they can all have their own URL's and they can all deliver customized experiences to their customers.

I also integrated the Spotify API to vote for the change of music that is currently playing, or add new songs. The controls of this are made with node.js
